## Discussion Monitoring

### General Advice

- Do your best to respond to students in a timely fashion. For issues that may take further investigation, inform students that you are looking into the issues and will get back to them shortly.

- When posting or responding in the discussion board try to support your claims and arguments with citations. If you are stating your opinion, make sure to mention that in your comment. 

- Students often forget to reference the location of the issue within the course. Politely ask them refer to the specific week/topic #, video #, question #, and time mark in the video so that you may better assist them.

- After you answer a student's question, try to stimulate further discussion. For example, you could ask a follow up question or ask other students to chime in.

- When posting or responding in the discussion board try to support your claims and arguments with citations. If you are stating your opinion, make sure to mention that in your comment.

- If a student makes outlandish claims, it may be easiest to address the topic by asking where they have heard that idea. This can lead to a discussion about the veracity and reputation of sources.

###  Following Discussion Threads

After responding to a student post, **follow** the post by pressing the star icon. This will notify you if a student asks a follow up question, or response on that post at a later date.

## Common Discussion Forum Issues

Students will typically have several issues with regards to the discussion forum:

### Students Unable to Upload Images

They may have problems uploading images to their posts. This is commonly because the image size is limited, and they do not know how to compress the image. In this case, you might ask them to find an image elsewhere on the internet and share the link, or simply to describe the image. 

### Students Posting Answers in Discussion Posts

Students may post answers to problem questions in the forum. We encourage students to ask for clarification and ensure their understanding but we ask that students avoid posting the answers to problems. Should students create a post containing answers replace their answers with "XXXX". Add an explanation for the edit at the bottom of the post. 

Note: Posting and discussing ungraded problems answers is fine, but posting answers to graded problems before the deadline has passed is not.

### Students Categorizing Discussion Posts as Discussions or Questions

Students who are new to edX may categorize their posts incorrectly. Remind the students that for their future posts, they have the option of classifying the post as either **discussion** or **question**. If their post was incorrectly categorized as a question, mark your response as the answer. Additionally, you can edit their post and change the categorization manually.
