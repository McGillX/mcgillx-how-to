<span id="common-discussion-forum-issues"></span><h2>Common Discussion Forum Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#common-discussion-forum-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Students will typically have several issues with regards to the discussion forum:</p>

<span id="students-unable-to-upload-images"></span><h3>Students Unable to Upload Images<a class="headerlink" href="#students-unable-to-upload-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>They may have problems uploading images to their posts. This is commonly because the image size is limited, and they do not know how to compress the image. You can advise them to use an online application like Image Optimizer (http://www.imageoptimizer.net/Pages/Home.aspx) to compress the image to a smaller size. Otherwise, you might ask them to find an image elsewhere on the internet and share the link, or simply to describe the image.</p>

<span id="students-posting-answers-in-discussion-posts"></span><h3>Students Posting Answers in Discussion Posts<a class="headerlink" href="#students-posting-answers-in-discussion-posts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students may post answers to problem questions in the forum. We encourage students to ask for clarification and ensure their understanding but we ask that students avoid posting the answers to problems. Should students create a post containing answers replace their answers with &#8220;XXXX&#8221;. Add an explanation for the edit at the bottom of the post.</p>
<p>Note: Posting and discussing ungraded problems answers is fine, but posting answers to graded problems before the deadline has passed is not.</p>

<p>Students who are new to edX may categorize their posts incorrectly. Remind the students that for their future posts, they have the option of classifying the post as either <strong>discussion</strong> or <strong>question</strong>. If their post was incorrectly categorized as a question, mark your response as the answer. Additionally, you can edit their post and change the categorization manually.</p>

<div class="section" id="utc-time-zone-due-dates">
<span id="utc-time-zone-due-dates"></span><h2>UTC Time Zone Due Dates<a class="headerlink" href="#utc-time-zone-due-dates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Students will frequently be confused by the due dates, not realizing that the deadlines are stated in the UTC/GMT time zone. You can suggest they visit use a website such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html">timeanddate</a> to convert UTC time to their local time. The &#8220;<strong>Course Info</strong>&#8221; tab also has a UTC Clock in the side bar that students may find helpful.</p>
<p>We try to avoid issues of confusion by setting soft deadlines, meaning the deadline that appears to students is often many hours in advance of the actual deadline. However, this is not something which we publicize to students.</p>

<span id="problems-with-drag-and-drop"></span><h2>Problems with Drag and Drop<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-with-drag-and-drop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Students may complain about not being able to complete the drag-and-drop questions on their tablets or phones. Notify them this is a limitation of the edX platform which McGillX has no control over. edX is working towards creating mobile friendly interactions for the future. Advise them to answer the questions on another device.</p>

<div class="section" id="browser-related-issues">
<span id="browser-related-issues"></span><h2>Browser Related Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#browser-related-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many technical issues students report can be resolved by using an alternative browser. Ask them which browser and on what device the issue arouse. We advise against using Internet Explorer; suggest Chrome or Firefox as an alternative. Chrome often has the fewest issues.</p>
<p>Issues can result if they have disabled javascript; advise them to enable JavaScript when using the edX platform. For directions on enabling javascript in Chrome see <a class="reference external" href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/12654?hl=en">https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/12654?hl=en</a></p>

<span id="student-progress-page"></span><h2>Student Progress Page<a class="headerlink" href="#student-progress-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If students are curious about their course progress and grading, refer them to their <strong>Progress Page</strong>. This is accessible from the main header.</p>
<p>As a course assistant, to check a specific students progress, click the <strong>Instructor</strong> tab, then the <strong>STUDENT ADMIN</strong> sub-tab. Insert the student&#8217;s email address or username into the box, and click the &#8220;<strong>Student Progress Page</strong>&#8221; hyperlink.</p>

<span id="problem-submission-history"></span><h2>Problem Submission History<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-submission-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a student complains about answering a question correctly, but having it scored wrong, check the student&#8217;s response to question. You can do this as well in the case that the student complains about a glitch of any sort.</p>
<p>To look at a student&#8217;s responses to a specific question:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li>Find the question location in the courseware. (Students will typically complain about specific questions located on a single page.)</li>
<li>Click &#8220;<strong>SUBMISSION HISTORY</strong>&#8221; and enter the student&#8217;s username. You can now scroll through all of the students submissions, and see the location of the question. At times it might be hard to find the answer in the code (which is written in JSON), so keep in mind what the answer should look like.</li>

<p>If a student has made a valid complaint about a question, and you decide to reset their answer submissions, find the question in the courseware and click &#8220;<strong>STAFF DEBUG INFO</strong>&#8221;. Enter the student&#8217;s username, and click &#8220;<strong>Reset Student Attempts</strong>&#8221;.</p>
