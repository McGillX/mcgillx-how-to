Transcription
=============================

Overview
---------------------------------------------------

Transcriptions are generated for most course videos and are displayed alongside the video on the edX platform. Transcription allows students to quickly view and search videos for specific content. It also facilitates access for learners with certain impairments. 
McGillX uses a transcription service called `rev <https://www.rev.com//>`_; once transcripts are completed by rev, transcriptions need to be manually updated to the course specifications and checked to ensure accuracy. This section describes the transcription process.

Uploading Transcripts to Rev
---------------------------------------------------

1. Direct your browser to `rev <https://www.rev.com//>`_
2. Log in using the account associated with the course which has videos requiring transcription
3. Under `Order History <https://www.rev.com/account/orderhistory>`_ click "Place New Order" in the top right
4. Select "Captions" from the dropdown
5. Choose "FROM YOUTUBE" as the option
6. Select the account for the associated course
7. Click "Allow" on the permissions window that appears
8. Select the video or videos and click "Add Selected to Cart"

Manual Upload Transcripts to Youtube
---------------------------------------------------

Rev normally returns transcripts to the associated Youtube video automatically. Ocassionally, there have been issues with the automation, requiring manual upload to Youtube. 

1. Log onto the McGillx Content Manager account on Youtube. If your account is linked to the McGill account, you can access this by clicking the icon in the top left corner [labeled “1.” in the screenshot]. If your account is not linked, request access from the system administrator.
