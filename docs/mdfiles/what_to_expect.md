## What to Expect

* In the first few weeks of the course, expect a lot of student introductions. You do not need to respond or read all of these.
* Student participation in the forum will drop off substantially as the course continues.
* Some students will not check the syllabus and complain once they miss a deadline. Generally, these deadlines are not changed based on individual requests.
* Students will post responses to staff initiated discussion questions in individual posts instead of the designated staff threads. If you respond to these, advise them to respond to the appropriate thread in the future.
* Students starting the course late will be discussing topics already covered by the majority of the class. It may be helpful to refer these newer students to specific forum posts in which those topics were covered.
